This directory includes the Spread toolkit, its monitor (called spmonitor)
and the sample user (spuser).

The directory also includes a sample spread.conf file - configuring
Spread. You HAVE to change the multicast address and the spread port
(currently the multicast address is 226.1.2.5 and port 4813).
You should use your assigned port and IP multicast address.

The best would be to uncomment only the 5 computers you use.
Do not forget to terminate all existing daemons before changing
your daemon configuration (if you would like to switch computers).
